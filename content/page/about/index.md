### The Journey
My path into cybersecurity didn't start with a tutorial on "how to hack." It started with a terminal, managing servers, and troubleshooting network loops. My background as a **Sysadmin** taught me how production environments actually breathe, which now gives me a unique advantage in offensive security: **I know what the logs look like on the other side.**

### The Vision
My objective is the mastery of **End-to-End Offensive Operations**. I am building toward becoming a well-rounded Red Teamer capable of moving from initial reconnaissance to deep exploitation and impact. I focus on understanding the underlying physics of a network—how data moves and where trust is misplaced—rather than just running automated scripts.

### Philosophy & Interests
I operate on the principle of **deep focus**. I value non-generic knowledge and the pursuit of technical depth.
