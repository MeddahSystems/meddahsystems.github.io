### Executive Summary
During a routine reconnaissance phase on a private bug bounty program, I identified an Out-of-Band SSRF vulnerability in the PDF generation engine.

### The Chain
1. **Discovery:** Identified an endpoint `/api/v1/generate` accepting a `source_url` parameter.
2. **Bypass:** Used a DNS rebinding technique to bypass the internal IP blacklist.
3. **Impact:** Successfully retrieved AWS metadata credentials from `169.254.169.254`.

```bash
# Example payload used
curl -X POST [https://target.com/api/v1/generate?source_url=http://](https://target.com/api/v1/generate?source_url=http://)[redacted].com/metadata
